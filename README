WeeIP is a simple but complete working transport-network protocol stack for 8-bit microprocessors.
Its current version supports Microchip PIC18Fx7J60 family of microcontrollers, but it can be easily ported to other architectures.

Some features:
* Both TCP and UDP protocols supported
* ARP address resolution incorporated
* Multiple socket support, both client and server
* Lightweight, small foot-print code
* Specially targeted for 8-bit microprocessors
* Easy to learn API, based on the SOCKET opaque structure
* Event-driven design pattern makes it easy to integrate with existing applications
